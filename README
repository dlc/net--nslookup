NAME
    Net::Nslookup - Provide nslookup(1)-like capabilities

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Nslookup;
      my @addrs = nslookup $host;

      my @mx = nslookup(qtype => "MX", domain => "perl.org");

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Nslookup provides the capabilities of the standard UNIX command
    line tool nslookup(1). Net::DNS is a wonderful and full featured module,
    but quite often, all you need is `nslookup $host`. This module provides
    that functionality.

    Net::Nslookup exports a single function, called "nslookup". "nslookup"
    can be used to retrieve A, PTR, CNAME, MX, and NS records.

      my $a  = nslookup(host => "use.perl.org", type => "A");

      my @mx = nslookup(domain => "perl.org", type => "MX");

      my @ns = nslookup(domain => "perl.org", type => "NS");

    nslookup takes a hash of options, one of which should be *term*, and
    performs a DNS lookup on that term. The type of lookup is determined by
    the *type* (or *qtype*) argument. If *server* is specified (it should be
    an IP address, or a reference to an array of IP addresses), that server
    will be used for lookups.

    If only a single argument is passed in, the type defaults to *A*, that
    is, a normal A record lookup. This form is significantly faster than
    using the full version, as it doesn't load Net::DNS for this.

    If nslookup is called in a list context, and there is more than one
    address, an array is returned. If nslookup is called in a scalar
    context, and there is more than one address, nslookup returns the first
    address. If there is only one address returned (as is usually the case),
    then, naturally, it will be the only one returned, regardless of the
    calling context.

    *domain* and *host* are synonyms for *term*, and can be used to make
    client code more readable. For example, use *domain* when getting NS
    records, and use *host* for A records; both do the same thing.

    *server* should be a single IP address or a reference to an array of IP
    addresses:

      my @a = nslookup(host => 'boston.com', server => '4.2.2.1');

      my @a = nslookup(host => 'boston.com', server => [ '4.2.2.1', '128.103.1.1' ])

TIMEOUTS
    Lookups timeout after $Net::Nslookup::TIMEOUT seconds (default 15). Set
    this to something more reasonable for your site or script.

DEBUGGING
    Set $Net::Nslookup::DEBUG to a true value to get debugging messages
    carped to STDERR.

TODO
    *   Support for TXT and SOA records.
