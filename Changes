	* MANIFEST (1.6), MANIFEST.SKIP (1.1), Makefile.PL (1.3), test.pl
	(1.4), lib/Net/Nslookup.pm (1.10):   o Defers loading Net::DNS
	until it needs it, so that simple lookups
	    will be faster.
	
	  o Added qslookup, which uses Socket and the system's resolver to
	do
	    lookups.
	
	  o Revamped Makefile.PL.
	
	  o Removed test.pl -> I can't figure out a way to reliably test
	dns
	    without knowing the addresses in advance, and that's the
	problem
	    this module is trying to solve.  My previous solution,
	hardcoding
	    some addresses that I thought would last a while, has failed
	(all
	    the addresses in question have changed).

	* test.pl (1.3), lib/Net/Nslookup.pm (1.8): (foo)

2001-11-05 09:48  dlc

	* lib/Net/Nslookup.pm (1.7): Added support for using LOCALDOMAIN or
	/etc/resolv.conf, as indicated by resolv.conf(5).  Domain names
	will now be suffixed by all elements in the search domain path
	until a match is found.

2001-09-20 09:08  dlc

	* MANIFEST (1.4), lib/Net/Nslookup.pm (1.6): Added test.pl to
	MANIFEST.  Updated examples in Nslookup.pm to correspond with the
	tests in test.pl.

2001-09-20 09:07  dlc

	* test.pl (1.2): Added functional tests (does lookups against
	perl.org hosts).

2001-09-20 08:58  dlc

	* lib/Net/Nslookup.pm (1.5): Calls to nslookup return if there is
	nothing passed in, but after creating the Net::DNS::Resolver
	object. This can be used to "seed" the module by pre-creating the
	object.  Lookups of MX and NS records return IP addresses rather
	than hostnames, by recursively calling nslookup as needed.
